# Video-Game-Sales-with-K-means
Visualizing Video Game Sales with K-means in hopes of understanding the underlying patterns of the data.

The landscape of video games is changing rapidly, with technological improvements seemingly occurring every year. In addition to the perceived improvements, video games are now more expensive and reviewing video games has become a major sector. After being burned out on pre-ordering games, I and some of my friends now wait for the game to launch in order to read/watch reviews in order to make an informed purchase. I plan to visualize and cluster the data so as to find patterns that contribute to video game sales. I will specifically be looking at ‘Average_Score’ as my main target variable.

Additional questions that I plan to answer include:

    What game region has sold the most? This is important as it helps to showcase the differences in sales across regions.
    What game has the highest rating? Also important in how you view the highest rated game from the realm of critic/user reviews.
    Does the highest critic rating have the highest user rating as well? To showcase the relationship between critic and user ratings.
    Which console system has sold the most? Also show how other systems compare. This can be used to showcase which console contributed to the highest video game sales.
    Show the most popular video game genres. A fun metric to look at.
